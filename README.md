# The Fennec Modem

Hello and thank you for looking in here!

APRN is a combined pairing of bell202 from packet radio, with SSTV and other more analog formats. While never widely adopted, I always had a strong affection for the strange format! The inspiration for this format was originally recorded [here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20080328040214/http://web.usna.navy.mil/~bruninga/aprntxt.html)

The Fennec Modem is designed with APRN in mind! But is in no means only limted to that one format, any AFSK or similar audio/soundcard mode radio should be possible with this board!
